# Employee-Data-Transformation
Introduction:
The code is designed to handle effective and end date calculations, data transformation, and data copying while maintaining unchanged values across different records. It provides detailed explanations of each method and its purpose within the codebase.

The approach taken in this code is to transform employee data from a columnar format to a historical, row-based versioning format. Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1. Reading Input CSV:
   - The code begins by defining a function `read_input_csv(file_path)` to read the input CSV file and return a pandas DataFrame. This function ensures that the data can be easily accessed and manipulated.

2. Identifying and Converting Date Columns:
   - Another function `identify_and_convert_date_columns(df)` is defined to identify columns containing date information by checking for the presence of the word 'date' (case-insensitive) in their names. It then 
     converts the values in these columns to datetime format using pandas' `to_datetime` function.
   - This approach ensures that date columns within the DataFrame are correctly identified and converted to a standardized datetime format, facilitating consistent handling and manipulation of date-related data 
     throughout the transformation process. By converting date columns to datetime objects, it enables easier comparison, calculation, and analysis of temporal data within the DataFrame.

3. Calculating Tenure:
   - The `calculate_tenure(row)` function calculates the tenure (in years) of an employee based on their joining and exit dates. It takes a row of data as input and computes the tenure using the difference 
     between the exit date (or the current date if missing) and the joining date.
   - This approach ensures that the tenure calculation is accurately performed, accounting for missing exit dates and providing a clear representation of the employee's duration of employment in whole years.It 
     also helps us in analysis and decision-making based on the length of service for each employee.Tenure is calculated in years and rounded to the nearest whole number.

4. Expanding Records:
   - The main transformation process is handled by the `expand_records(df, date_columns)` function. This function iterates over each row of the input DataFrame.
   - For each row, it identifies unique dates from the date columns and creates an initial record with employee code, effective date (joining date), and other non-date columns.
   - It includes the calculation of 'Tenure in Org' for each record using the `calculate_tenure` function and initializes the 'Variable Pay' column with a default value of 0.
   - For each unique date, it creates a new record by copying the existing record and updates compensation, review, and engagement values based on the corresponding date.
   - Finally, it assigns a far-future date (2100-01-01) as the 'End Date' for the last record to indicate an ongoing period.
   - Overall, this method effectively converts each row of the input DataFrame into multiple records representing various time periods, ensuring that changes in employee data are accurately captured and organized 
     for further analysis or storage.

5. Saving Transformed Data:
   - Once the transformation is complete, the function saves the transformed DataFrame to a CSV file specified by the `output_file_path`.
   - This step ensures that the transformed data is persisted for further analysis or storage.

6. Main Execution:
   - The purpose of the fucntion is to mechanism the entire data transformation process.
   - Begins by specificing the input and output file for data retrieval and storage.
   - Reads the input CSV file, identifies and converts date columns,
   - performs the data transformation, saves the transformed data to the output CSV file, and prints a message indicating the successful completion of the transformation process.

Overall, the approach focuses on efficiently processing the input data, transforming it into a structured format suitable for analysis, and ensuring accuracy in handling date-related calculations and record expansions.

Usage:

To use the code for transforming employee data, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Python and required libraries are installed.
2. Provide the input CSV file path and output file path in the code.
3. Run the script.
4. Check the output CSV file for the transformed data.
5. The final transformed output csv file is uploded seperatly.

Conclusion:

The code provided offers appropriate solution for transforming employee data into a historical, row-based versioning format. By following the guidelines outlined in this document, users can easily understand and utilize the code for their data transformation needs.
